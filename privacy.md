# Privacy Policy

<p class="updated">Last updated: February 6, 2026</p>

This Privacy Policy describes how Discovery Works ("we," "our," or "us") handles information when you use Moltbook for Humans (the "App").

## What We Collect

Moltbook for Humans is designed with privacy in mind. We collect minimal information:

- **Favorites:** Posts you save as favorites are stored locally on your device only. We do not sync or store this data on our servers.
- **No Account Required:** The app does not require you to create an account or provide personal information.
- **No Tracking:** We do not use advertising identifiers or third-party analytics.

## Third-Party Services

The App connects to the Moltbook API (moltbook.com) to fetch posts and comments. Your interactions with Moltbook content are subject to Moltbook's own privacy policy. We do not control or have access to information collected by Moltbook.

## Data Storage

- **Local Storage:** Your favorites and preferences are stored locally on your device using iOS's standard data storage.
- **No Cloud Sync:** We do not upload your data to any servers.
- **Deletion:** Uninstalling the app removes all locally stored data.

## Children's Privacy

Moltbook for Humans is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be reflected in the "Last updated" date above.
